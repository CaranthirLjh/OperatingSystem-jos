- You can switch to branch 'labx' to see the implementation of each stage.
- Each lab's implementation and contribution are shown in corresponding branch.
## Requirement
- I recommend you to use ubuntu-16.04.2(32-bit) to run this operating system.
- You can use the virtual machine provided by us.
  ```
    wget http://ftp.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu-cd/16.04.2/ubuntu-16.04.2-desktop-i386.iso
  ```
## Test
- Switch to branch 'labX' if you want to test labX's implementation.
- Please ‘make’ in the directory before you run the testing scripts.
- Run testing scripts 'grade-labX'.
  ```
    $ git checkout labX 
    $ cd labX
    $ make
    $ ./grade-labX
  ```
